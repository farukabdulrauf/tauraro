# Advanced — Lifetimes

> This is an advanced topic. Core Tauraro development does not require understanding this. See the [Advanced Docs Index](README.md).

## Overview

Tauraro's ownership model (see [chapter 13](../13_memory_and_ownership.md)) tracks who owns each heap-allocated value. The lifetime system extends this to *pointers* and *borrows* — specifically, to functions that return a `Pointer[T]` or `ref T` into data they do not own.

The problem: if a function returns a pointer into one of its parameters, the compiler must know which parameter the pointer came from. Without this, it cannot verify that the caller still owns that data when they use the returned pointer.

The solution is the `from` keyword, which annotates the *lifetime source* of a returned pointer.

---

## When You Need This

You need `from` annotations only when **all three** of these are true:

1. Your function returns a `Pointer[T]`, `ref T`, or `mut_ref T`
2. The pointer points into a parameter's data (not heap memory you allocate yourself)
3. The function has two or more non-primitive parameters (single-param case is auto-inferred)

If you are returning owned values (the common case), you never need `from`.

---

## Syntax Reference

```
def function_name(params...) -> ReturnType from param_name:
    ...
```

The `from param_name` clause comes after the return type and before the colon. It tells the compiler: "the returned pointer's lifetime is bounded by `param_name`."

For `ref` and `mut_ref`:

```
def function_name(x: SomeType) -> ref SomeType from x:
    ...

def function_name(x: SomeType) -> mut_ref SomeType from x:
    ...
```

---

## Examples

### Single Parameter — Auto-Inferred (no annotation needed)

When a function has exactly one non-primitive parameter and returns a pointer, the compiler automatically infers that the pointer comes from that parameter:

```python
# No annotation needed — compiler infers 'from data'
def get_first(data: List[int]) -> Pointer[int]:
    return data.raw_ptr()

def main():
    mut nums = [10, 20, 30]
    mut p = get_first(nums)    # p is valid as long as nums is alive
    print(p.read())            # 10
    # nums is still in scope — p is safe to use
```

### Multiple Parameters — Must Annotate

When there are two or more non-primitive parameters, the compiler cannot infer which one the returned pointer comes from. You must annotate:

```python
# Must annotate — two non-primitive params
def pick(a: List[int], b: List[int], use_a: bool) -> Pointer[int] from a:
    if use_a: return a.raw_ptr()
    return a.raw_ptr()    # annotation says lifetime source is 'a'
                          # so we must always return from 'a'
```

If you need to return from either `a` or `b` depending on a condition, return an owned value instead:

```python
def pick_value(a: List[int], b: List[int], use_a: bool) -> int:
    if use_a: return a[0]
    return b[0]    # returns a copy — no lifetime concern
```

### Using ref and mut_ref

`ref T` is a read-only borrow. `mut_ref T` is a mutable borrow. Both use `from`:

```python
def find_max(data: List[int]) -> ref int from data:
    mut best = 0
    mut i = 1
    while i < len(data):
        if data[i] > data[best]: best = i
        i = i + 1
    return ref data[best]    # read-only reference into data

def increment_first(data: List[int]) -> mut_ref int from data:
    return mut_ref data[0]   # mutable reference into data
```

### The Error This Prevents

Without `from`, returning a pointer to a local is caught as [M-4]:

```python
# WRONG — triggers M-4:
def get_ref() -> Pointer[int]:
    mut x = 42
    return &x       # M-4: x is freed when function returns

# RIGHT — return by value:
def get_value() -> int:
    return 42
```

---

## How the Compiler Enforces This

When the compiler sees a call site like:

```python
mut p = get_first(nums)
```

It knows `p`'s lifetime is bounded by `nums`. If you try to use `p` after `nums` has been moved or freed, the compiler emits [M-4]:

```python
mut nums = [10, 20, 30]
mut p = get_first(nums)
send_away(nums)           # moves nums — ownership transferred
print(p.read())           # M-4: nums was moved, p is now dangling
```

## Common Mistakes

**Annotating `from` with the wrong parameter.** If you annotate `from a` but sometimes return a pointer into `b`, the compiler will allow the code — but at runtime, callers who keep the returned pointer while allowing `b` to be freed will have a dangling pointer. Annotation must match reality.

**Using `from` instead of returning by value.** If you just need the data, return it by value. `from` is only useful when zero-copy access into the original buffer is a measured necessity.

**Assuming `from` works like Rust lifetimes.** In Rust, lifetime parameters appear on every usage site. In Tauraro, `from` is only on the return type of the function that returns the pointer. Callers don't need to annotate anything.

---

## Best Practices

- **Default to value semantics.** Return owned values. This eliminates all lifetime concerns at the cost of a copy. Copies of primitive values and small structs are free. Copies of large buffers may matter — measure first.
- **Use `from` only for proven hot paths** where zero-copy access is measurably important.
- **Never use `from` on public library APIs.** Callers must manage the lifetime constraint, which is an invisible contract. Return owned values in public APIs.
- **Single-parameter functions don't need annotation.** The auto-inference is intentional — don't add redundant `from x` when there's only one non-primitive param.
